# Text_Based_Game

This is an adventure puzzle game mapped out for you entirely with text.
You will be given a map to look at at various times throughout the game and you will need to move your character around to reach your ultimate goal.

The map is a square of 9 rooms (3 x 3) that requires the player to pick up and drop specific items that are placed in each of the rooms. There are weight limits and capacity limits to the number of items a player can hold. When items are dropped in one room, they will remain in that room even if the player moves to another room.

You have a choice of main character, each with different attributes and strengths for the journey ahead!

There are random chances for battle with wild creatures and longtime foes on this journey. The battle function will randomly select the foe and the player will need to defeat them through a turn-based battle system (like Pokemon). Player health will not regenerate unless they beat one of the 3 randomly generated "bosses" who belong to the rival group that placed our main character on this precarious journey. Randomized counters will determine if the player pulls strength from their duty to their family and the good of the realm, or if their foe draws on their treachery to gain and edge in battle. This will affect attack/defense capabilities on each turn of battle to ensure no two games or battles are the same.

Feel free to check out the images I attached to see how the functions of the game work.
